        We might redo, not sure; because we do have login system.
        But if we do, we will have to create custom lobbies and whatnot
        Could go about it in the way of user who hosts gets a code and player
        who joins gets a code. If websockets too complicated we just end up doing
        customs only. Random queueing might be hard.
